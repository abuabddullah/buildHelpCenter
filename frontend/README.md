## How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?

I can implement shared functionality across a component tree using React Context API, custom hooks, or Redux.

- React Context API: It allows for the creation of a centralized context that provides shared state or functions to any component within the tree, effectively avoiding prop drilling

- Custom hooks: It offers a way to encapsulate reusable logic, enabling the same functionality to be easily shared among multiple components without redundancy.

- Redux: It handles sharing by maintaining a single global state that can be accessed and modified by any component in the application through actions and reducers

## Why is the useState hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?

- The useState hook is appropriate for managing states in a complex component because it provides a simple and easy way to declare state variables.
- It returns a state variable and a function to update that variable, allowing components to re-render when the state changes.
